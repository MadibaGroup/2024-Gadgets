# Polynomial Commitment Schemes (PCS)

## KZG

**Definition 1 (Polynomial Commitment Scheme).** A polynomial commitment scheme (PCS) is an interactive proof system that enables $\mathcal{P}$ to convince $\mathcal{V}$ that he knows a polynomial, without revealing the polynomial directly. $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ run the protocol in three moves: **gen**, **com**, and **open**.
